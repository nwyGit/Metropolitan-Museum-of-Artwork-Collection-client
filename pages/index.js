								The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its
								mission to bring art and art education to the American people.
								The museum&apos;s permanent collection consists of works of art
								from classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and
								sculptures from nearly all the European Old Masters, and an
								extensive collection of American and modern art. The Met
								maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceanian,
								Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is home to encyclopedic
								collections of musical instruments, costumes, and accessories,
								as well as antique weapons and armor from around the world.
								Several notable interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome through
								modern American design, are installed in its galleries.
